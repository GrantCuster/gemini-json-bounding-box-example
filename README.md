# Gemini JSON bounding box example

An example front-end for how to prompt and then display bounding box info from the Gemini API.

A fancier example is available at https://github.com/GrantCuster/gemini-spatial-example.

Put your Gemini API Key (get from https://ai.google.dev/) into the `example.env` file and rename to `.env`. Use `npm install` and `npm run dev` to run locally.
